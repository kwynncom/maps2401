<section><h1>documentation of Big Evil Goo(gle) Maps polygons and such</h1>

<div>
	
	<p>If you click the map and then start moving the pointer, you'll draw a line.  If you click again, the line segment ends and moving will make the next 
		side of the polygon.  When you touch the original point, after 3 or more segments, Goo will shade the area of the polygon.  </p>
	
	<p>I need to display markers (pins) based on user data and then allow the user to select a polygon.  Then I will check (on the server side) whether the 
		various pins are within the polygon.  </p>
	
	<p>Here, I'm documenting this process and making note of non-obvious points.</p>
	
	<p>For this first version, the code is (essentially) all on the front-end (so you can see it in a browser).  Some notes on the code, starting (more or less) from 
		top to bottom:
	</p>
	
	<p>To start with the API script line, the browser console complained if I didn't have the async and callback params.  Given the way the callback is 
		declared, I defined initMap() above the Goo API inclusion (script tag).  If I didn't do this, I could get an error to the effect that initMap() is 
		undefined because it needs to be defined before the API inclusion line.  
		Apparently one has to declare one's libraries, too.  The drawing library 
		allows one to draw the polygon.  
		
	</p>
	
	<section><h3>defining a Goo Cloud Project and the API key</h3>
		
		<p>To get an API key, you have to create a Goo Cloud project in the <a href='https://console.cloud.google.com/'>Cloud console</a>.  You have to 
			include the Maps API in the project (using the console).  You (almostly certainly) must have Billing / a payment method attached to the project.  
			I am not certain about Maps alone.  I started with a related API, and it enforced a payment method.  Maps alone must likely would enforce this, too.
		</p>
		
		<p>Note that the API key is publicly available in the HTML code, so you should secure its use.  So far, I'm testing 4 different types of restrictions.  
			
		</p>
		
		<p>You set API, http referrer and IP restriction in the APIs & Services / Credentials Goo Cloud (console) menu.  Note that IP restriction dosen't 
			work in this case because the users' IP addresses are sent to the API from JavaScript / their browsers.  My project is using 2 APIs, so I restricted the 			key to Maps.  
		</p>
		
		<p>Under AIM & Admin, you can set "Quotes & System Limits" per minute and day. 
			
		</p>
		
		<p>I'll link (eventually) to the prices for Maps.  The amount wouldn't matter unless someone were malicious or you have a lot of users.  
			During 6 hours of testing, I would 
			have run up 41 cents, although there are mysterious "credits" have have made that 0.  I have not figured out where those credits are coming from or how 
			many I have.  Under "Budgets & Alerts," you can set alerts when the money value goes beyond certain points.  Based on my experience, the billing report				takes at least 7 hours to catch up with usage.  I'm not sure yet how long the quota count report takes: at least 45 minutes.
			</p>

	<section><h3>back to the code</h3>
		
		<p>There were no surprises with the Map or Marker calls.  The Marker "title" is the hover-over text.  
			</p>
			
			<p>It was very important to define the proper drawingMode for the drawing tools.  That setting makes the user's actions a polygon draw by default.  
				The drawingControl(s) would give the user several options.  I turned them off (false) because I just care about polygons right now.
				</p>
				
				<p>When the user connects back to the starting point and creates a polygon, the relevant handler gives the vertices of the polygon in the 
				"coordinates" array in my code.  
					
				</p>
		
				<p>I included the click handler (in the original version) only to point out that it does not do what I expected.  It doesn't even fire at all, as best I can tell, at least 
					not with my settings.  Supposedly the raw DOM click handler fires then the drawing tools then the map, but I'm not sure that happens, and 
					it's not useful in my case in any event. The "polygoncomplete" action is all I care about for now.
					
				</p>
