<section><h1>documentation of Big Evil Goo(gle) Maps polygons and such</h1>

<div>
	
	<p>If you click the map and then start moving the pointer, you'll draw a line.  If you click again, the line segment ends and moving will make the next 
		side of the polygon.  When you touch the original point, after 3 or more segments, Goo will shade the area of the polygon.  </p>
	
	<p>I need to display markers (pins) based on user data and then allow the user to select a polygon.  Then I will check (on the server side) whether the 
		various pins are within the polygon.  </p>
	
	<p>Here, I'm documenting this process and making note of non-obvious points.</p>
	
	<p>For this first version, the code is (essentially) all on the front-end (so you can see it in a browser).  Some notes on the code, starting (more or less) from 
		top to bottom:
	</p>
	
	<p>To start with the API script line, the browser console complained if I didn't have the async and callback params.  Given the way the callback is 
		declared, I defined initMap() above the Goo API inclusion (script tag).  Apparently one has to declare one's libraries, too.  The drawing library 
		allows one to draw the polygon.  
		
	</p>
	
	<section><h3>defining a Goo Cloud Project and the API key</h3>
		
		<p>To get an API key, you have to create a Goo Cloud project in the <a href='https://console.cloud.google.com/'>Cloud console</a>.  You have to 
			include the Maps API in the project (using the console).  You (almostly certainly) must have Billing / a payment method attached to the project.  
			I am not certain about Maps alone.  I started with a related API, and it enforced a payment method.  Maps alone must likely would enforce this, too.
		</p>
		
		<p>Note that the API key is public, so you should secure its use.
